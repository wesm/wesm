Most people know me as the creator of [pandas][1], but I also
co-created [Apache Arrow][2] and [Ibis][8].

I'm currently a Principal Architect at [Posit PBC][11], Chief Scientist
at [Voltron Data][4], and a General Partner at [Composed Ventures][12].
I am a Member of the [Apache Software Foundation][7]. Before my current
roles, I worked at Two Sigma Investments, Cloudera, and co-founded DataPad.

I [blog occasionally on my personal website][9].

You can [sponsor me][5] with GitHub Sponsors. I donate at least $1000
each year to [NumFOCUS][10] to support pandas and also encourage you
to consider donating there, too.

My book [Python for Data Analysis][3] (3rd Edition, 2022) is a comprehensive
introduction to the Python data stack including pandas, NumPy, IPython, and
Jupyter. It's been used by hundreds of thousands of data scientists and analysts
worldwide.
