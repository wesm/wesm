Most people know me as the creator of [pandas][1] but I work full-time on
[Apache Arrow][2] now and direct [Ursa Labs][4].

You can [sponsor me][5] or [sponsor Ursa Labs][6] with GitHub Sponsors.

My book [Python for Data Analysis][3] is in its 2nd edition and is a great
introduction to the Python data stack (IPython, NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib).
